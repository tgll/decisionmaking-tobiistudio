**Decision making and training of tennis novice and high skilled players using eye tracking**


What really differentiates an expert from a beginner?

Highly skilled tennis players rely on decision making techniques and visual patterns that shift up their accuracy and speed. Today’s eye tracking technologies allow us to record their gaze spots when they watch a game on video.

The purpose of this study is to compare abilities in decision making and information gathering during a tennis serve between skilled and novice right-handed players. This experiment is the first step in a larger innovation study on cognitive training.

We have designed a protocol to measure individual gaze behavior. Each participant watches several short serve videos and must choose between three possible landing spots for the ball. The use of an eye-tracking device and the Tobii Studio software allows for an analysis in real-time. We then extract data from the software and make statistical analysis to compare participants.

We haven’t completed our test panels yet but we expect results that clearly show higher guessing accuracy from skilled players.

We ran this experiment during our third year degree’s project (TER : Travail d’Etude et de Recherche) with the support of the Akiani startup company.
